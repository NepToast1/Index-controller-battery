This is a repo for my extra Lipo that I attached to my left index controller.
It should work with the right one as well, if so, please tell me so.

I expect some knowledge about electronics and wiring things up.

Tools you need are: a wire stripper, soldering iron, solder, a heat gun for shrink tubes.

To prevent shorts, use hot glue or the like to fill up the charging IC housing with IC in it.

I don't take any responsibilities, if something breaks, or you hurt yourself.
Read up everything that you don't understand.
If you have further questions, DM on Twitter @NepToast
